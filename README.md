# Luau-application
The code I wish to demonstrate is in TurnModule.
However, there is a helper script called TileModule, which helps create the grid for the demonstration. 
There are, unfortunately, a few scripts working together. Other scripts are mainly just for helping with
the demonstration as well. I included TileModule to give you a better sense of what it the grid might
look like. There's also some code in TileModule that's foundationally solid if you're interested.
